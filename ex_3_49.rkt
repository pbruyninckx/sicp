; Ex. 3.49

; Scenario:
; - lock your stuff first
; - thing to change is based on value in your stuff
; - lock other thing afterwards
;
; Contrived example:
; Get value in your account
; Locate account with closest value
; switch with the other one
;
; This can probably be done using the normal stuff,
; but I hope the gist is clear.
